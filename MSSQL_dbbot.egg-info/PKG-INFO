Description: MSSQL DbBot
        =====
        
        This is a forked version of DbBot, which is a Python script to serialize Robot Framework produced test run results, i.e. output.xml files, into a database. This version serializes the results into a Microsoft SQL Server database to provide the future Robot Framework related tools and plugins with a unified storage for the test run results.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        * Python 2.6 or newer installed
        * Robot Framework 2.7 or newer installed
        * Pymssql 2.7 installed. The downloads can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/pymssql/downloads/list) 
        
        Robot Framework version 2.7.4 or later is recommended as versions prior to 2.7.4 do not support storing total elapsed time for test runs or tags.
